# Captcha-generation
Hi friends,

I have created this code and you can try it using this procedure..

Step :1 
  Copy the code a into file and save it as PHP file. OR download the files using the pull requests in GITHUB and open it in visual studio 
  
Step :2
  Save the files in a folder and put that folder in the server folder eg. MAMP, etc. it is for running PHP files on the web browser.
  
Step 3: 
  If you don't have already downloaded server folder download it in C: drive and then store the folder in that.
  
Step 4:
  Start the server and go to preferences keep the remaining settings same but change the Apache port number to 8080 and select the folder location as Document root where 
  you have stored the files 
  
Step 5:
    In the web browser run localhost:8080 it will show all the files in the folder which you had given in Document root.
    
Step 6:
    Select phpEx.php file and the captcha question will appear
    
 Step 7:
    Enter correct characters to find out that you are human or not.
    
    Enjoy!!! this mini captcha version...
